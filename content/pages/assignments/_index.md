Weekly Reading Reflections
--------------------------

Each week, every student is to prepare a brief 2-page reflection on that week's reading assignment, to be turned at the Tuesday class of each week.

Book Review
-----------

Students will select a book from the list of "related readings" provided for most class sessions, write a formal book review, and also make a brief presentation about the subject to the class.

The review paper should be an example of your best work. It should be 4 to 6 pages long, double-spaced. Carefully proofread and correct your paper before turning it in.

Final Reflection Paper
----------------------

A longer final reflection paper of 8-10 pages, double spaced, will be due the last day of class. Its purpose should be to look back at the term's readings and discussions and come to some conclusions about what you have learned from them.
